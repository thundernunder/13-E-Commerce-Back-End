<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Challenge 13 involves creating a back-end e-commerce application. Completing this challenge allowed me to demonstrate my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript (including Node, MySql, Sequelize, and DotENV).</p> 

<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>Make sure to have GitBash, Node.js, and VSCode installed for sucess. Further installations would be to install NPM MySql, Sequelize, and Dotenv.</p>

<h2>Useage</h2>
<p>Fist, install all node packages by entering 'npm i' into the command line. Once installations are complete, seed the data by inputting 'node seeds/index.js' into the command line. Finally, input 'npm start'.</p>

<h2>Contribution</h2>
<p>Feel free to message me if you have any ideas on how to make this better!</p>

<h2>Test</h2>
<p>No formal tests are provided for this project. However, ongoing testing was performed to ensure the database was running properly with MySQL Workbench. Test were also performed to ensure route functionality with Insomnia</p>
